## 🎯 Why am I building DevHub?

I am building DevHub to showcase my ability to design and build a **full-fledged production-grade application** that integrates AI, API services, and scalable architecture.  
It is my flagship project to stand out in front of HRs and recruiters, demonstrating my **skills in modern technologies, product thinking, and clean code practices**.  
Additionally, I want this project to be a **transformative learning journey**, exploring technologies I haven’t worked with before to gain deep confidence in my engineering capabilities.

## 💡 Problems DevHub Solves

1. Developers waste time switching between multiple platforms (GitHub, LinkedIn, AI tools) daily. DevHub brings them into a **single productivity dashboard**, saving time and improving workflow efficiency.

2. Many developers lack access to an AI coding assistant integrated with their workflow. DevHub provides **Dev.AI** for quick code explanations, refactoring, and debugging directly from their dashboard.

3. There is no unified platform to view **coding contributions, professional network insights, and AI assistance together**, making DevHub a unique offering for personal productivity.
